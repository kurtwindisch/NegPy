"""Merge an assembled frame into one linear RGB TIFF that replaces the files it is made of.

A Trichrome triplet and a stitch composite both become a single working negative: fewer
files to keep, and the frame's edit carries over.

The buffer comes from the render decode (`ImageProcessor._load_source_f32`), not Linear
Output's own decode, so the file holds exactly the source the pipeline inverted. Which
corrections are baked differs by kind, and `decode_params` is where that is decided.
